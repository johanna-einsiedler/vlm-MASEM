TAS-20 ROBUSTNESS / VERIFICATION PROMPT (LOGPROB-READY)
Task
You are given:
One image of a single PDF page from a scientific article.
A candidate JSON extraction of TAS-20 factor loadings.
Your task is to VERIFY, for THIS PAGE ONLY, whether each extracted value is supported by the visible content.
Do NOT infer from other pages.
If a table is continued and the relevant rows or values are not visible on this page, treat them as NOT VERIFIABLE.
What to Verify
Verify exactly the information types allowed by the original extraction task:
Item-level standardized factor loadings
Keys of the form:
F1.1 … F1.20
F2.1 … F2.20
F3.1 … F3.20

Use the following factor mapping rules:
F1 = DIF (Difficulty Identifying Feelings)
F2 = DDF (Difficulty Describing Feelings)
F3 = EOT (Externally Oriented Thinking)
Unless the page explicitly defines a different mapping.
Output Format (STRICT)
Return VALID JSON ONLY, parsable by json.loads().
No extra text.
{
"samples": [
{
"sample_id": "string",
"factor_loadings_verdicts": {
"F1.1": "V|N|U|X",
"F1.2": "V|N|U|X",
"...": "...",
"F3.20": "V|N|U|X"
}
]
}
Verdict Codes (CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE PER KEY)
Use ONLY these single-character codes:
V = Verified
The value is clearly visible on the page and matches the candidate JSON.
N = Not verified (mismatch)
A value is visible, but it does NOT match the candidate JSON.
U = Uncertain
The table/value appears present, but reading or assignment is ambiguous
(e.g., blurred image, unclear column alignment, unclear sample separation).
X = Not present on this page
The value cannot be verified because it is not visible on THIS page
(e.g., table continues, different page, or value never shown).
Rules 
Judge ONLY what is visible on this page.
Do NOT infer values from other pages.
Do NOT infer symmetry in correlation matrices unless explicitly shown.
If a factor loading was set to 0.0 because it was suppressed or not reported:
Use X if suppression or absence is explicit.
Use U if unclear whether suppression applies.
If multiple samples are present, verify each sample separately.
Do NOT invent missing keys.
Always describe ambiguity, continuation, or layout issues in the notes field.
