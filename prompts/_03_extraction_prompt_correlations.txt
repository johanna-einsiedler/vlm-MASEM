Goal

Extract 
Extract TAS-20 (2003)  (Toronto Alexithymia Scale, 20-items) factor correlation information from the provided markdown file.

Specifically:
Extract factor correlations between latent factors (e.g., Factor 1–Factor 5) as reported in the file (correlation matrix / “Phi” matrix / latent factor correlations).


What to output

Return exactly one valid JSON object (parsable by json.loads). No extra text.

Key rules

Multiple samples:
If the file reports multiple groups/samples (e.g., language groups, clinical vs nonclinical, Sample 1 vs Sample 2), output one separate object in the "samples" list per sample.
Do not combine samples.
If unclear which values belong to which sample, create separate samples only if the file visibly separates them; otherwise use one sample and explain ambiguity in "notes".

Correlation key normalization:
Represent each unique factor-pair correlation using the key format:
- R<i>.<j> where i < j
Example: correlation(Factor 1, Factor 2) -> R1.2
Assume correlations are symmetric; do not output both R1.2 and R2.1. Only output the i<j form.

Factor numbering:
Use the factor numbering as shown in the file (Factor 1, Factor 2, …).
If the file uses names (e.g., DIF, DDF, EOT), map them to factor numbers only if the file explicitly defines the mapping; otherwise keep the factor indices implied by the table headings and explain any ambiguity in "notes".

Required keys:
For each sample, always include all keys listed in the schema:
R1.2, R1.3, R1.4, R1.5, R2.3, R2.4, R2.5, R3.4, R3.5, R4.5

If the file has fewer than 5 factors, set correlations involving non-existent factors to null and explain in "notes".
If the file has more than 5 factors, extract at least the correlations among Factors 1–5 as above, and note that additional factor correlations exist but were not extracted due to schema constraints.

Filling values:
- If a correlation is explicitly reported for a factor-pair, record it as a number (negative allowed; typically in [-1, 1]).
- If the file has fewer than 5 factors, set correlations involving non-existent factors to null.
- If the correlation is not reported / suppressed / not visible / table cut off, set it to null.
- SPECIAL CASE: If the file explicitly states that correlations were NOT computed or are NOT available (e.g., orthogonal rotation, independent factors, no correlation matrix reported), set ALL correlation values to 0 instead of null.
  (Important: only use 0 when correlations are confirmed to not exist; otherwise use null for missing/unreported values.)

Multiple models / methods:
If the file shows multiple correlation solutions (e.g., EFA vs CFA, Model A vs Model B):
- Extract only the solution clearly labeled as the main/final/preferred model.
- If unclear, extract the first complete correlation matrix shown and explain uncertainty in "notes".

Strict output constraints:
- Output must be valid JSON only (no commentary outside JSON).
- Use null for missing/unreported correlations.
- Put any uncertainty, ambiguity, or “table continues / not fully visible” issues into the "notes" string.

sample_id guidance:
Use a short identifier derived from visible labels e.g.:
"english", "french"
"sample1", "sample2"
"clinical", "nonclinical"
If no label is visible, use "sample1".

Now perform the task on the provided file and output JSON.
