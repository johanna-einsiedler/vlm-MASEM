Task
You are shown one image of a single PDF page from a scientific article.
Determine whether this page contains at least one table reporting either:
 - Factor loadings for the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), OR
Correlations involving TAS-20 factors or TAS-20 items.
Output Rule
Return:
1 if the page contains any table with TAS-20 factor loadings or TAS-20 correlations.
0 if the page contains neither.
What Counts as 1
Return 1 if any visible table on the page includes numeric values (typically between −1 and 1) and clearly relates to TAS-20, including but not limited to:
Factor loadings:
Item-level loadings for items 1–20
Columns or rows labeled DIF, DDF, EOT, Factor 1, Factor 2, Factor 3
Headings such as: Factor Loadings, Pattern Matrix, Measurement Model, Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Correlations:
Correlation matrices or tables involving TAS-20 factors (e.g., DIF–DDF, F1–F2)
Correlation tables involving TAS-20 items (e.g., item 1 × item 2)
Headings such as: Interfactor correlations, Correlation matrix, Inter-item correlations
Partial tables or tables marked as continued count.
What Does Not Count as 1
Fit indices only (CFI, RMSEA, chi-square, AIC)
Reliability tables only (Cronbach’s alpha, omega)
Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations)
Text-only mentions of correlations or loadings
Tables unrelated to TAS-20
Output Format

Rules
Judge only the visible page.
Do not infer content from other pages.
If unsure, return 0.
Do not hallucinate.
