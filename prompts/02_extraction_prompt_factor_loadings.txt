Goal

Extract TAS-20 (2003) (Toronto Alexithymia Scale, 20-items) factor-analytic information from the provided markdown file.

Specifically:
Extract item-level standardized factor loadings for TAS-20 items 1–20, allowing for up to FIVE factors (F1–F5).


What to output

Return exactly one valid JSON object (parsable by json.loads). No extra text.

Key rules

Multiple samples:
If the file reports multiple groups/samples (e.g., English vs French; clinical vs nonclinical; Sample 1 vs Sample 2), output one separate object in the "samples" list for each sample.
Do not combine samples. If unclear whether values belong to which sample, create separate samples only if the file visibly separates them; otherwise use one sample and explain ambiguity in notes.


Factor naming normalization (when applicable):
- If the paper clearly uses the standard TAS-20 three-factor structure, map:
  F1 = DIF (Difficulty Identifying Feelings)
  F2 = DDF (Difficulty Describing Feelings)
  F3 = EOT (Externally Oriented Thinking)
  Accept synonyms such as:
  “Difficulty identifying feelings” -> DIF -> "Factor 1" -> F1
  “Difficulty describing feelings” -> DDF -> "Factor 2" -> F2
  “Externally oriented thinking” -> EOT -> "Factor 3" -> F3

- If the paper defines a different factor naming or ordering, follow the paper’s definition.
- If the solution has 4 or 5 factors, do NOT invent meanings for F4/F5 unless explicitly defined in the file. Keep them as Factor 4 / Factor 5 (or mapped equivalents) and explain any ambiguity in notes.


Item identification:
Recognize TAS-20 items by:
- item numbers 1–20, and/or
- recognizable item text fragments (e.g., “I am often confused about what emotion I am feeling”, etc.).
Use the item number as the canonical identifier.


Factor loadings representation:
Output must include keys for all items 1–20 for each factor F1, F2, F3, F4, F5:
F1.1 … F1.20, F2.1 … F2.20, F3.1 … F3.20, F4.1 … F4.20, F5.1 … F5.20.

IMPORTANT:
- If the extracted solution has fewer than 5 factors (e.g., 3-factor model), then for non-existent factors set ALL corresponding loadings to null (e.g., all F4.* and F5.* = null) and explain in notes.
- If the extracted solution has more than 5 factors, extract only Factors 1–5 (as presented/ordered in the table) and note that additional factors exist but are not represented by the schema.


Table structure note (merged / spanning headers):
It may happen that a table uses multi-level headers where:
- a super-heading spans multiple columns (e.g., “Factor loadings” spanning F1–F3), and/or
- a group label spans multiple factor columns (e.g., “Sample 1” spanning several columns), and/or
- factor names appear as subheaders under a broader heading, possibly shifted due to column spans.

Rules for handling this:
- Treat spanning headers as structural grouping only; do not misinterpret them as separate variables.
- Determine the true factor columns by reading the lowest-level header row that directly labels the numeric loading columns (e.g., DIF/DDF/EOT or Factor 1/2/3).
- If the markdown representation loses the column-span formatting (common in parsed tables), reconstruct the intended column alignment by using:
  (a) repeated header labels,
  (b) consistent number of numeric columns per row,
  (c) row-wise patterns (each item should have the same count of loading entries across the row),
  and document any uncertainty in notes.
- If the header structure is too ambiguous to recover column identities, extract the numbers row-wise as best as possible, apply CFA assignment rules only when allowed (see below), and explain the ambiguity in notes.


If results stem EXCLUSIVELY from CFA:
- If the CFA is a THREE-factor solution and the table does NOT explicitly label which items belong to which factor (e.g., only one loading per item or a path diagram without a full matrix), you MAY assume the standard TAS-20 three-factor item assignment:
    F1 = items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14
    F2 = items 2, 4, 11, 12, 17
    F3 = items 5, 8, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20
  Use this ONLY to decide where to place a single reported loading per item when factor identity is otherwise not recoverable from the page.
- For CFA models with MORE or FEWER than three factors: do NOT assume any a priori item-to-factor assignment. Only use the factor structure as explicitly shown on the page and explain limitations in notes.


Fill values as follows:
- If a loading is explicitly shown for an item–factor cell, record it as a number (negative allowed).
- If the table suppresses or does not report that cell (e.g., below-threshold, blank cells in a loading matrix), set it to 0.0.
- Do not impute or estimate.
- If the table reports only primary loadings (one factor per item), enter the reported loading in that factor’s key and set the other factors for that item to 0.0 (for factors that exist in the solution).
- Use null only when:
  (a) an entire factor does not exist in the extracted solution (e.g., F4/F5 in a 3-factor model), OR
  (b) the needed table/values are genuinely not visible in the provided file (e.g., cut off / missing page / “table continues”).


Multiple models / rotations / methods:
If the file shows multiple loading solutions (e.g., EFA vs CFA, rotated vs unrotated, Model A vs Model B):
- Extract only the solution that is clearly labeled as the main/final/preferred model.
- If unclear, extract the first complete loading table shown and explain uncertainty in notes.


Strict output constraints:
- Output must be valid JSON only (no commentary outside JSON).
- Use 0.0 only for suppressed/unreported loading cells within an existing factor.
- Use null for non-existent factors or genuinely not visible content.
- Always put any uncertainty, ambiguity, or “table continues” issues into the notes string.


Sample_id guidance:
Use a short identifier derived from the visible labels e.g.:
"english", "french"
"sample1", "sample2"
"clinical", "nonclinical"
If no label is visible, use "sample1".

Now perform the task on the provided file and output JSON.
