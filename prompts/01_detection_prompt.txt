TAS-20 PAGE-LEVEL TABLE CLASSIFICATION PROMPT
Task
You are shown one image of a single PDF page from a scientific article.
Determine whether this page contains at least one table reporting:
Factor loadings for the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and/or
Correlations involving TAS-20 factors or TAS-20 items.
You must classify the page into exactly one of four options.
Output Rule
Return exactly one of the following single-letter outputs:
A → Factor matrix only
B → Correlation matrix only
C → Both factor matrix and correlation matrix
D → Neither factor matrix nor correlation matrix
What Counts as a Factor Matrix
A factor matrix is present if any visible table on the page includes numeric values (typically between −1 and 1) and clearly represents factor loadings for TAS-20, including but not limited to:
Item-level loadings for items 1–20
Columns or rows labeled DIF, DDF, EOT, Factor 1, Factor 2, Factor 3
Headings such as: Factor Loadings, Pattern Matrix, Measurement Model, Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Standardized or unstandardized loadings from EFA or CFA
What Counts as a Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix is present if any visible table on the page includes numeric values (typically between −1 and 1) and clearly represents correlations involving TAS-20, including:
Correlations between TAS-20 factors (e.g., DIF–DDF, F1–F2)
Correlations between TAS-20 items (e.g., item 1 × item 2)
Lower-triangular, upper-triangular, or full correlation matrices
Headings such as: Interfactor correlations, Correlation matrix, Inter-item correlations
Partial tables or tables marked as “continued” count.
What Does Not Count
The following do NOT count as either factor or correlation matrices:
Fit indices only (CFI, RMSEA, chi-square, AIC)
Reliability tables only (Cronbach’s alpha, omega)
Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations)
Regression coefficients unrelated to factor analysis
Text-only mentions of loadings or correlations
Tables unrelated to TAS-20
Decision Rules
If the page contains only a factor matrix → output A
If the page contains only a correlation matrix → output B
If the page contains both → output C
If the page contains neither → output D
Rules
Judge only the visible page.
Do not infer content from other pages.
If unsure, output D.
Do not hallucinate.
Output Format
Output exactly one character:
A
B
C
or
D
No explanation.
No extra text.
No formatting.
