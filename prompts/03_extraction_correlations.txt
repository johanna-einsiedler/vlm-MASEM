TAS-20 PAGE CORRELATION EXTRACTION PROMPT (VLM)
Input
You are shown one image of a single PDF page from a scientific article.
Goal
Extract any TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale, 20-item) correlation information shown on THIS page only. Specifically:
Correlations between TAS-20 factors, and/or
Correlations between TAS-20 items.
Do NOT extract factor loadings in this task.
Important
Do NOT infer values from other pages.
If a correlation table is continued from a previous or next page and the current page does not show all rows/columns, extract only what is visible and note the limitation.
What to output
Return exactly one valid JSON object (parsable by json.loads).
No explanation.
No extra text.

Key rules
Multiple samples
If the page reports multiple groups or samples (e.g., English vs French; clinical vs nonclinical; Sample 1 vs Sample 2), output one separate object in the "samples" list for each sample.
Do not combine samples.
If it is unclear which correlations belong to which sample, create separate samples only if the page visibly separates them; otherwise use one sample and explain ambiguity in the notes field.
Factor naming normalization
Map factor names used in the paper to F1/F2/F3 as follows unless the paper explicitly defines a different mapping:
F1 = DIF (Difficulty Identifying Feelings)
F2 = DDF (Difficulty Describing Feelings)
F3 = EOT (Externally Oriented Thinking)
Also accept synonyms such as:
“Difficulty identifying feelings” → DIF → F1
“Difficulty describing feelings” → DDF → F2
“Externally oriented thinking” → EOT → F3
If the paper labels factors as “Factor 1 / Factor 2 / Factor 3” without descriptive names, do not guess; map Factor 1→F1, Factor 2→F2, Factor 3→F3 and record uncertainty in notes.
Factor correlations
Use keys:
R1.2 (correlation between F1 and F2)
R1.3 (correlation between F1 and F3)
R2.3 (correlation between F2 and F3)
If a factor correlation is explicitly reported on this page, record the numeric value (range −1 to 1).
If not reported on this page, use null.
Do NOT set missing correlations to 0.0.
Item identification
Recognize TAS-20 items by:
item numbers 1–20, and/or
recognizable TAS-20 item text fragments (e.g., “I am often confused about what emotion I am feeling”).
Use the item number as the canonical identifier.
Item correlations
Use keys of the form rI.J where I < J (e.g., r1.2, r1.3, … r19.20).
If an item correlation is explicitly shown on this page, record its numeric value.
If the table/matrix is partially visible, extract only the visible correlations and set all others to null.
If item correlations are not reported on this page at all, all item-correlation keys should be null.
Do NOT infer symmetric values that are not visible.
Multiple correlation tables / models
If the page shows multiple correlation matrices (e.g., different models, different samples, or pre/post):
Extract only the matrix clearly labeled as the main, final, or primary results for this page.
If unclear, extract the first complete correlation table shown and explain the ambiguity in notes.
Metadata extraction
If visible on the page, extract:
n (sample size)
group_label (e.g., “English-speaking”, “French-speaking”, “clinical”, “Sample 1”)
language (e.g., English, French)
If not visible, set metadata fields to null.
Strict output constraints
Output must be valid JSON only.
Use null for genuinely missing correlations or metadata.
Never invent, average, or interpolate values.
Always describe uncertainty, partial tables, or continuation issues in the notes field.
Sample_id guidance
Use a short identifier derived from visible labels on the page, e.g.:
"english"
"french"
"sample1"
"clinical"
If no label is visible, use "sample1".
Now perform the task on the provided page image and output the JSON.
