Goal
Extract any TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale, 20-item) factor-analytic information shown on THIS page only. Specifically:
Item-level standardized factor loadings for TAS-20 items 1–20, and/or
Correlations (between TAS-20 factors and/or between TAS-20 items).
Important: Do NOT infer from other pages. If a table is continued from a previous/next page and the page does not contain the needed rows/values, record what is visible and note the limitation.
What to output
Return exactly one valid JSON object (parsable by json.loads). No extra text.
JSON schema
{
"samples": [
{
"sample_id": "string",
"factor_loadings": {
"F1.1": number, "F1.2": number, ... "F1.20": number,
"F2.1": number, ... "F2.20": number,
"F3.1": number, ... "F3.20": number
},
]

Key rules
Multiple samples:
If the page reports multiple groups/samples (e.g., English vs French; clinical vs nonclinical; Sample 1 vs Sample 2), output one separate object in the "samples" list for each sample.
Do not combine samples. If unclear whether values belong to which sample, create separate samples only if the page visibly separates them; otherwise use one sample and explain ambiguity in notes.


Factor naming normalization:
Map factor names used in the paper to F1/F2/F3 as follows unless the paper explicitly defines a different mapping:
F1 = DIF (Difficulty Identifying Feelings)
F2 = DDF (Difficulty Describing Feelings)
F3 = EOT (Externally Oriented Thinking)
Also accept synonyms such as:
“Difficulty identifying feelings” -> DIF -> F1
“Difficulty describing feelings” -> DDF -> F2
“Externally oriented thinking” -> EOT -> F3
If the paper labels factors as “Factor 1/2/3” without names, do not guess mapping; keep the factor numbers as printed and map Factor 1->F1, Factor 2->F2, Factor 3->F3, and mention uncertainty in notes.
Item identification:
Recognize TAS-20 items by:
item numbers 1–20, and/or
recognizable item text fragments (e.g., “I am often confused about what emotion I am feeling”, etc.).
Use the item number as the canonical identifier.
Factor loadings representation:
Output must include keys for all items 1–20 for each factor F1, F2, F3 (i.e., F1.1 … F1.20, F2.1 … F2.20, F3.1 … F3.20).

Fill as follows:
If a loading is explicitly shown for an item-factor cell, record it as a number (negative allowed).
If the table suppresses or does not report that cell, set it to 0.0 (use 0.0 for unreported/suppressed/below-threshold loadings).
Do not impute or estimate.
If the table reports only primary loadings (one factor per item), enter the reported loading in that factor’s key and set the other factors for that item to 0.0.

Multiple models / rotations / methods:
If the page shows multiple loading solutions (e.g. EFA vs CFA, rotated vs unrotated, Model A vs Model B):
Extract only the solution that is clearly labeled as the main/final/preferred model on this page.
If unclear, extract the first complete loading table shown and explain uncertainty in notes.

If not visible, set to null.
Strict output constraints:
Output must be valid JSON only (no commentary outside JSON).
Use null for genuinely missing correlations/metadata.
Use 0.0 only for missing loadings cells.
Always put any uncertainty, ambiguity, or “table continues” issues into the notes string.
Sample_id guidance
Use a short identifier derived from the visible labels on the page, e.g.:
"english", "french"
"sample1", "sample2"
"clinical", "nonclinical"
If no label is visible, use "sample1".
Now perform the task on the provided page image and output the JSON.
